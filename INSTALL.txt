System requirements
-------------------

ViTables 2.1 has been tested against Python 2.6 and 2.7 and the latest
versions of PyTables (up to version 3.2) and PyQt4. You can try other
versions at your own risk :).

Installation on a conda environment
-----------------------------------

Using conda you should be able to run vitables on any system, let it
be linux, mac or windows. The following are instructions for linux-like
systems.

Install conda:
  http://www.conda.io

Clone vitables...
```sh
  git clone git@github.com:uvemas/ViTables.git
  cd ViTables
```
...or download it
```sh
  wget https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables/archive/master.tar.gz
  tar xzvf master.tar.gz
  rm -f master.tar.gz
  cd ViTables-master
```

You can use the provided ```environment.yml``` file to create a new
environment with the minimal dependencies needed to run vitables:
```sh
  conda env create -n vitables -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment whenever you want to run vitables
```sh
  source activate vitables
  vitables [whatever.h5]
```

Installation on Windows platforms
---------------------------------
Just double click the installer icon and follow the wizard instructions.

If you prefer to launch ViTables from the command line then install it
following the instructions given in the next section.


Installation on Linux platforms
-------------------------------

The Python Distutils are used to build and install ViTables. Provided your
system fulfills the requirements listed in the above section, installing
the package is really easy. Just uncompress it, change to the distribution
directory and execute (as root)

 $ python setup.py install

If you are doing this on a MacOS X platform, please make sure that the
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable has been setup properly.

By default ViTables will be installed in the system-protected area where
your system installs third party Python packages so you will need superuser
privileges. If you prefer to install the package in a different location
(for instance, your home directory) so that the installation can be done by
non privileged users, you can do it using the --prefix (or --home) tag

 $ python setup.py install --prefix=/home/myuser/mystuff

Please, remember that installing Python modules in non-standard locations
makes it necessary to setup properly the PYTHONPATH environment variable so
that the Python interpreter can find the new modules.

If you need further customizations, please have a look to the output of the
command

 $python setup.py install --help

to see all the available options. Complete information about them can be
found in the Distutils documentation.

Installation on MacOS X platforms
---------------------------------
For getting a double-clickable application bundle do the following:

- uncompress the tarball
- change to the distribution directory
- change to the macosxapp directory
- execute the make.sh script

If you prefer to launch ViTables from the command line then install it
following the instructions given in the previous section.
